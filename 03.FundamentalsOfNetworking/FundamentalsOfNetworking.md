## Need of Address
- An address is needed to identify where data should be sent and received on a network. Just like a home address ensures mail reaches the 
  right house, an IP address ensures that data packets reach the correct device on the internet.

## How a Packet travels over Internet 
- Packets are small pieces of data sent over the internet. They are given addresses, travel through routers, and are reassembled at the 
  destination. If any packets are lost, they are resent to complete the data.

## Router and Routing Table
- **Router**: A router is a device that connects multiple devices to the internet and each other. It sends data to the right destination, 
              acting like a traffic manager for networks. It also provides security features like firewalls to protect the network.
- **Routing Table**:

## Understand request for www.google.com 
- A Google request is when a user enters a query in Google to find information. Google analyzes the query, determines the intent, and 
  displays the most relevant results (websites, images, or videos). For content creators, itâ€™s about matching user needs with optimized, 
  clear, and useful content.
-----
## Protocols 
- Set of rules to send the data.
- **Rules** HTTP, SMTP, FTP

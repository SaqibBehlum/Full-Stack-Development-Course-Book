## HTML Tags
- An HTML (HyperText Markup Language) tag is a predefined element used to structure and format content on a webpage. Tags are the building 
  blocks of HTML and define how the browser should display content.
-----

## Types of Tag
- There are 3 types of tag.
------ 
## Meaning Tag or Semantic tag  
- Semantic HTML tags are tags that clearly describe their meaning and role in the structure of a webpage, both to browsers and 
  developers.
 - Examples: `<h1>` = Heading Tag  ,
 -   `<p>` = Paragraph Tag 
 -   `<a>` = ancher tag (for link) 
 -   `<table>`= Table Tag 
 -   `<img>` = Image Tag 
 -   `<ul>` = Un Orered List tag
-----
## Structure Tag
- Structure tags in HTML are used to organize and define the layout of a webpage. These tags help in creating a logical and hierarchical 
  structure for content, making it easier for browsers, developers, and search engines to interpret the document
  -  Examples:  `<html>` = The root element that encloses all content on the page. 
  -  `<head>` = Contains metadata, links to stylesheets, scripts, and the title of the document. 
  -  `<body>` = Contains the visible content of the webpage. 
  -  `<nav>` =Defines a set of navigation links. 
  -  `<main>` = Represents the main content of the document. 
  -  `<section>` = Defines a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. 
  -  `<article>` = Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article. 
  -  `<aside>` = Contains content tangentially related to the main content, like a sidebar or advertisements. 
  -  `<footer>` = Represents the footer of a document or section. Commonly contains copyright or contact information.

## Formatting Tag
- A formatting tag is an element in markup languages like HTML, used to style and format text or content within a web document.
    -  Examples: `<b>` : Makes text bold 
    -  `<strong>` : Indicates strong importance (usually displayed as bold).
    -  `<i>`   : Makes text italic.
    -  `<em>`  : Indicates emphasized text (usually displayed as italic).
    -  `<code>`: Formats text as computer code.
    -  `<mark>`: Highlights text (yellow by default).
    -  `<u>`   : Underlines text.
    -  `<sub>` : Displays subscript text (smaller and below the baseline).
    -  `<sup>` : Displays superscript text (smaller and above the baseline).
    -----
## What is Attribute
-  An attribute provides additional information about an element. Attributes are always defined within the opening tag of an element.
    - Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=). The value is enclosed in quotes (" or '), though 
       quotes are optional in some cases.
     -  Examples: 
     - ![](/ 
## HTML List 
- Lists are used to group related items. There are three primary types of lists:
  ## Order List
  - An ordered list displays items in a specific order, usually numbered.
     ```html
    <ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
        </ol>
    ```
  ## UnOrder List
  - An unordered list displays items without a specific order, typically marked with bullets.
   ```html
    <ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Oranges</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>

 ## Description List
  - A Description List in HTML is used to define a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions. It is typically used for 
    glossaries, definitions, or other types of paired information.
```html
 <dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</dd>

  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document.</dd>

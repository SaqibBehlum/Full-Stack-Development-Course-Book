## What is IDE?
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides tools to make coding easier and more efficient. It 
  integrates essential tools developers need for writing and testing software.
-----
## Why use of VSCode?
- Because, It is begineer Friendly IDE : Link Of [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
-----
## What is HTML?
- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design the structure of web pages. HTML acts 
  as the backbone of most websites, defining the content and layout that a browser renders.
-----
## Structure Of HTML
    ```Html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html lang="en">
          <head>
           <meta charset="UTF-8">
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Document</title>
        </head>
        <body>  
       </body>
      </html>
      ```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the type of document as HTML5.Ensures the browser interprets the document correctly.
- **`<html>`**: The root element that encloses all the content of the HTML document.
- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document (not directly visible to users).
- **Common elements in `<head>`**:
  - **`<title>`**: Sets the title of the web page (displayed on the browser tab).
  - **`<meta>`**: Provides metadata like character encoding (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`) or viewport settings for responsive design.
  - **`<link>`**: Links to external stylesheets or resources.
  - **`<style>`**: Contains internal CSS for styling.
  - **`<script>`**: Links or embeds JavaScript files for interactivity.
- **`<body>`**: Contains all the visible content of the page.
- If you want Boiler of Code Than Press `Shift 1`

## Tags In HTML
-There are Three Basic Tags In HTML
##  Opening Tag 
-  An opening tag begins an element and indicates its purpose. It is written inside angle brackets (`<head>`).
   Example: `<head>`
## Closing Tag 
-  A closing tag marks the end of an element. It is similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash (`</>`) before the element's name.
  Example: `</head>` , Complete ex:  `<head>` , `</head>`
## Self Closing Tag 
-  Some HTML elements do not require a closing tag because they do not contain any content. These are called self- closing tags.             Example: `<img>` is a self-closing tag.
-----
## Comments in HTML 
- In HTML, comments are used to add notes or explanations within the code that are not visible on the webpage.
   - **syntax**: `<!-- This is a comment -->`
       - Anything between the `<!-- and -->` will be ignored by the browser.

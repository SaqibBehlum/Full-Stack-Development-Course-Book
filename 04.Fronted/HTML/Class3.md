    - *Tag for bookmark*: 
       - 1. Add an ID to the Target Element
       - 2. Assign a unique id to the element you want to link to. .
       - 3. Create an Anchor Link
    - Use the <a> tag with an href that matches the id of the target element.
    ```html
    <a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
         <section id="section2">
		 <h2>Section 2</h2>
	   	 <p>This is the second part of the page.</p>

       ```

    - *Italic Tag* `<I>`

    - *Emphasize Tag* `<em>`
       - 1. The `<em>`tag is used to add emphasis to text, and it often renders the text in italics by default.

           emphasized.
